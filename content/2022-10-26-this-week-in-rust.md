### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

An amazing week. We saw more wins than losses; I want to call out specifically
the wins from removing attributes from metadata (up to 8.2% faster builds for 18
benchmarks) and from enabling LTO for rustc_driver.so (up to 9.6% faster builds
for an epic 230 benchmarks, with *zero* regressions).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [e0f8e60d..629a414d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e0f8e60dddfecfc9093ee9d9f42557d8260c0355&end=629a414d7ba4caa3ca28b0a46c478e2ecb4c0059&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
53 artifact comparisons made in total

See [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-10-26.md) for details.

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.
